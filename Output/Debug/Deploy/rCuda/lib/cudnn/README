This is a dummy CUDA Deep Neural Network library (cuDNN) to avoid
rCUDA users installing the NVIDIA cuDNN library if they are not going
to use this library.

If you do not plan to use cuDNN, include the path to this library in
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable in the rCUDA server node.

On the contrary, if you plan to use cuDNN, remove the path to this
library from the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable in the rCUDA
server node, and add the path to the NVIDIA cuDNN library.
